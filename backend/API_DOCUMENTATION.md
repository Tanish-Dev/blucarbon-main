## Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
2. **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt for secure password storage
3. **Role-Based Authorization**: Granular permission control
4. **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request validation
5. **CORS Protection**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
6. **Database Security**: MongoDB with proper connection handling

## Mock Implementations

### CNN Image Analysis
Currently implemented as a mock that returns:
- Credibility score (0-1)
- Confidence level
- Analysis results (image quality, vegetation detection, anomalies)
- Recommendations

**To integrate your CNN model:**
1. Replace `mock_analyze_image_credibility()` function
2. Load your trained model
3. Preprocess uploaded images
4. Return analysis results in the same format

### IPFS Integration
Currently implemented as a mock that generates hash-based file identifiers.

**To integrate real IPFS:**
1. Set up IPFS node
2. Configure `IPFS_API_URL` environment variable
3. Replace `mock_upload_to_ipfs()` function
4. Handle IPFS client connections and error handling

### Blockchain Integration
Smart contracts are provided but integration uses mock implementations.

**To activate blockchain integration:**
1. Deploy the provided Solidity contracts to Polygon Mumbai
2. Set contract addresses in environment variables
3. Replace mock blockchain functions with real Web3 calls
4. Handle transaction signing and confirmation

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request (validation errors)
- `401`: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- `403`: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error

Error responses follow this format:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message description"
}
```

## Testing

The API has been tested with the following operations:
1. ‚úÖ User registration and authentication
2. ‚úÖ Project creation and management
3. ‚úÖ Field data collection
4. ‚úÖ Role-based access control
5. ‚úÖ Health check endpoint

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Deploy to Polygon Mumbai and update addresses
2. **Integrate CNN Model**: Replace mock with your trained model
3. **Set up IPFS**: Configure real IPFS node for image storage
4. **Add Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring
5. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
6. **Add Tests**: Create comprehensive test suite
7. **SSL/TLS**: Ensure HTTPS in production
8. **Database Backup**: Set up MongoDB backup strategy
